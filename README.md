# SerialUnity 
### A Simple way to read values from the serial port
#### Tagging data on the serial port with an ID creates an efficent way of sending multiple pieces of data out from a serial device to Unity which can then be accessed by ID in any gameObject. 
##### You can also send data out on Serial, but right now it is just a string that is sent without any labelling or anything clever. 
```Arduino
Serial.println("0>1000<1>2000<2>105<);
```
